					<i>Unfortunately, I didn't think to take any pictures until well into this project, so you won't see any until halfway down the page</i>
                    <p>My family recently moved into a new home. The previous owner had left behind an 18,000 dollar home theater system that included a whole bunch of equipment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>LG ~60 inch plasma TV (broken)</li>
                        <li>Universal Remote MX-900 and base unit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>THe first order of business was to remove the broken TV. Unmounting it was a relatively simple process. Mounting our working TV, however was not. The mount used by the previous owners was not VESA compatible (a standards system used for mounting TVs and monitors), meaning that we had to remove the wall-mount itself and purchase a new one. While I waited for that to arrive, I started tackling the other components.</p>
					<p>The electronics were a complete mess when I first saw them. I deeply regret not taking pictures of the situation, because it's hard to understand just how tangled everything was without pictures. Words simply can't do it justice, but I'll try anyways. For starters, there was dust everywhere. Cable management was incredibly random and haphazard, and completely unrelated cables had been tied together for no good reason. What gets me the most, however, are the extra cables. There were around 10 or so cables that simply were plugged into the receiver that served no purpose - they weren't plugged into anything else. Even more infuriatingly, these cables were often zip-tied to other cable that were actually in use. </p>
					<p>I had originally planned to keep most of the cabling intact and simply work around it, but it soon became clear that wasn't going to work. So, I removed all the cables from everything and started from scratch.</p>
