							                My passions in life include computer science and coding, Olympic weightlifting, and music. I'm currently enrolled in the Schreyer Honors College at Penn State, where I hope to obtain both a BS and MS in computer science. I've been playing the piano for most of my life, and creating music is one of my favorite things to do. I picked up Olympic weightlifting nearly two years ago, and have learned so much from it both about the sport and about myself. Space and technology are both incredibly interesting to me, and I hope to one day use my abilites to positively impact one or both fields in some way.

				                Computers have fascinated me since my grade school days. Seeing these mysterious black boxes that could browse the internet, play games, and do pretty much whatever else you told it to sparked my interest in computer science; how could I learn to manipulate this technology? I had seen my dad, a computer science major himself, writing software for his job. Something about seeing those lines of code scroll down the screen captivated me; and so, I begane learning how to code.

				                <p>
				                As a college student, despite my continued exposure to different learning experiences and opportunities, I'm still not quite sure what I want to do with my abilities. I'd like to work in some technology related field - that much is sure. Beyond that, however, I don't think I've yet found my true calling. Before college, I thought I wanted to work at some big, multi-national tech firm like Google or Facebook. After two semesters worth of fresh experiences at Penn State, I'm now not so sure.

				                Rocketry and the aerospace industry has grabbed my attention, mostly as a result of my participation in Lion Tech Rocket Labs. Through some of the people that I've met in the club, I got myself a summer internship with Lockheed Martin to develop and test software for a new helicopter. Software will (to me) always be infinitely cooler than hardware; hardware is still pretty cool though, and working with a company like Lockheed Martin would enable me to experience the best of both worlds.
				                </p>
				                <p>
				                As it stands, I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life. Maybe I'll go write code for some burgeoning startup. Maybe I'll help develop flight control systems for the next generation of aircraft. Maybe I'll drop out of college and go on to become the next Mark Zuckerburg (not really, but a man can dream, right?). All I know is that whatever I do, I want it to involve technology in some way. And thankfully, in today's ever-digitizing world, my possibilities are endless.
