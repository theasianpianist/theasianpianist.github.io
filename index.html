                &nbsp Computers have fascinated me since my grade school days. Seeing these mysterious black boxes that could browse the internet, play games, and do pretty much whatever else you told it to sparked my intereset in computer science; how could I learn to manipulate this technology? I had seen my dad, a computer science major himself, writing software for his job. Something about seeing those lines of code scroll down the screen captivated me; and so, I begane learning how to code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                &nbsp As a college student, despite my continued exposure to different learning experiences and opportunities, I'm still not quite sure what I want to do with my abilities. I'd like to work in some technology related field - that much is sure. Beyond that, however, I don't think I've yet found my true calling. Before college, I thought I wanted to work at some big, multi-national tech firm like Google or Facebook. After two semesters worth of fresh experiences at Penn State, I'm now not so sure. 
                </p>
                <p>
                &nbsp Rocketry and the aerospace industry has grabbed my attention, mostly as a result of my participation in Lion Tech Rocket Labs. Through some of the people that I've met in the club, I got myself a summer internship with Lockheed Martin to develop and test software for a new helicopter. Software will (to me) always be infinitely cooler than hardware; hardware is still pretty cool though, and working with a company like Lockheed Martin would enable me to experience the best of both worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                &nbsp   As it stands, I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life. Maybe I'll go write code for some burgeoning startup. Maybe I'll help develop flight control systems for the next generation of aircraft. Maybe I'll drop out of college and go on to become the next Mark Zuckerburg (not really, but a man can dream, right?). All I know is that whatever I do, I want it to involve technology in some way. And thankfully, in today's ever-digitizing world, my possibilities are endless.
